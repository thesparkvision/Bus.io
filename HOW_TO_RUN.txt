To run this application on Windows,

1. First install Python 3.5 or higher
    [Make sure you install Python in C:\Python\   as python has problem with space separated folders
     and make sure python is added to system path  and pip is checked in installation]

2. Go on cmd and type python --version to see if path is set.
    Type pip --version. If it is not installed,you have to install it manually from google by typing pip download

3. After pip is installed, type 
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools virtualenv
 and execute on cmd

4. Then type
   python -m virtualenv kivy_venv on cmd

5. Then type kivy_venv\Scripts\activate , 
  [Your terminal should now preface the path with something like (kivy_venv), indicating that the kivy_venv environment is active. If it doesn’t say that, the virtual environment is not active.]

6. Installing the dependencies,
    run this command on cmd:
    python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy_deps.sdl2==0.1.22 kivy_deps.glew==0.1.12

7. Then write python -m pip install kivy==1.11.1 and execute
